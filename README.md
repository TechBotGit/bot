Run /addfirstweek to set your first_week and first_recess_week
```

#### 4.1.1. Setting Student Type

You must set your student type before putting in your index. This is equivalent to declaring whether you are a part time student or a full time student.
To do this, you must first type in **/setstudenttype** or **/st**
The bot will then reply in the following manner:
```
Are you a full time or part time student?

```
You will be given two choices in the keyboard; "Full-Time Student" and "Part-Time Student". Click your Student Type. The bot will reply in the following manner:
```
Successful!
```

#### 4.1.2. Adding your First Week and First Recess Week

You must also enter your first week and first recess week in your bot. To do that, you must first enter **/addfirstweek** into the bot. 
```
Please Enter your first week and first recess week using the following format:

FirstWeek;FirstRecessWeek

For example:

2017-8-14;2017-10-2
```
Enter the dates in the above format. After you enter the dates, the bot will reply in the following manner:
```
Captured!

Your data is sucessfully recorded in our database!
```

After you have completed the process above, enter **/addcourse** into the bot, and the bot should reply you in the following manner:
```
Sure thing. Please type your details in following format:

Please type your course code below. For example, CZ1003
```
Type in your course code and the bot will output a keyboard listing all the indexes in that course as a mark-up keyboard and will return to you thr following message:
```
The indexes for this course code has been successfully accessed. Please do the instructions above :)
```

What you probably want to do next:

Run /addcourse to replace your removed course, if you wish

Run /removecourse to remove another course

Run /getcourse to list all the courses you have added
```
If removal is not successful, it may be caused by you entering the wrong course code and the bot will reply in the following manner:

```

## Chapter 5: Further Information
### Information 1: 

For any commands that requires you to input a **date**:

If the bot returns you this response:
```
Your format is correct, however we cannot perform the query to your Google Account
```
Then these cases may occur:

Case 1: You have problems with your API keys

Case 2: You entered a bad date, for instance your end time is earlier than your start time (Your event starts at 5 p.m. but ends at 4 p.m.)

For these two cases, you may want to resolve your API problem and run the **/addevent** again and give the bot a reasonable time interval.

### Information 2

If the bot responds in this following manner:
```
Cannot access the course
```
This can also be caused by these following cases:

Case 1: You may have problems with your browser driver, for instance you may have a problem with your chromedriver for Google Chrome.

Case 2: You may have entered a course code that **does not exist**

Case 3: You may have entered the wrong first week and first recess week. The **/addfirstweek** command can only accept a **Monday** as the start of the first week and first recess week.
