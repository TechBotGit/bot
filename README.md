## Chapter 1 Introduction
> [Back to contents](#contents)

### 1.1 Overview

This bot is a software written to help NTU students keep track of their course schedule and personal events. 
This bot allows you to automatically access your course schedule from STARS. You no longer have to worry about **ODD** and **EVEN** weeks as well as lectures and seminars occuring on **random** weeks through out the semester as the bot will automatically handle it for you. 
The bot also reminds you to attend your lectures, tutorials, labs and events **one hour** before respective events start in form of a **push notification**.

To recapitulate, there is no need for you to print your class schedule from STARS planner anymore. Furthermore, you don't have to manually check your class schedule if you want to add any personal events of your own (this is highly prone to error!) as the bot will automatically tell you if you are free on that time interval or not. In short, you can say good bye to the mindblowing **ODD* and **EVEN** weeks!

### 1.2 System Requirements

The bot requires Telegram versions released after 9 April, 2016 or Telegram Web.

## Chapter 2 Getting Started

## Chapter 4 Inputting Course Indexes and Finding Common Free Time
> [Back to contents](#contents)


### 4.1 Inputting Your Course

You can input your course in the bot. This way, the bot can tell you what courses you have throughout the day. To input your course's index, you must first type in **/addcourse**
If you have not completed some of your index, the bot will then redirect you to another instructions that you have to fullfill before adding your index.
The bot will reply in the following manner:
```
Sure thing

Hmm... Wait a second. You haven't told me enough data!

Run /setstudenttype to set your student type, i.e. Full Time or Part Time

Run /addfirstweek to set your first_week and first_recess_week
```

#### 4.1.1. Setting Student Type

You must set your student type before putting in your index. This is equivalent to declaring whether you are a part time student or a full time student.
To do this, you must first type in **/setstudenttype** or **/st**
The bot will then reply in the following manner:
```
Are you a full time or part time student?

```
You will be given two choices in the keyboard; "Full-Time Student" and "Part-Time Student". Click your Student Type. The bot will reply in the following manner:
```
Sucessfull! Your data has been recorded in our database!

Have you added your first week?

If you haven't, run /addfirstweek

If you have, then run /addcourse straight away!
```

#### 4.1.2. Adding your First Week and First Recess Week

You must also enter your first week and first recess week in your bot. To do that, you must first enter **/addfirstweek** into the bot. 
```
Please enter the Monday dates of your first week and first recess week using the following format:

FirstWeek;FirstRecessWeek

For example:

2017-8-14;2017-10-2

Notes: These two dates are very important. If you enter the wrong dates and add your course (i.e. by running /addcourse), consequently, your course schedule will be shifted by one or more weeks!
```
Enter the dates in the above format. After you enter the dates, the bot will reply in the following manner:
```
Sucessfull! Your data has been recorded in our database!

Have you set your student type?

If you haven't, run /setstudenttype

If you have, run /addcourse straight away!
```

#### 4.1.3 Adding Your Course Code

After you have completed the process above, enter **/addcourse** into the bot, and the bot should reply you in the following manner:
```
Sure thing. Please type your details in following format:

Please type your course code below. For example, CZ1003
```
Type in your course code and the bot will output the following message:
```
Please wait while we process your information. This may take around a minute.

To prevent crashing, please wait until the Success message has appeared.
```

Then the bot will display a keyboard listing all the indexes in that course along wit the message:
```
Please choose your index below.
 Click only one of them once!
```
and 
```
The indexes for this course code has been successfully accessed. Please do the instructions above :)
```
Pay careful attention to the second message. Click on the index **once**. This is very important, as clicking the twice may result in an error in your database.

After you have clicked on your chosen index, the bot will reply in this following manner:
```
Nice!

CZ1003 (index 10628) has been added to your Google Calendar and our database

What you probably want to do next:

Run /addcourse to add another course

Run /removecourse to remove a course

Run /getcourse to list all the courses you have added
```
The course schedule has now ben inputted in your Google Calendar.

### 4.2 Removing Your Course

You can remove your index if you have put in the wrong index, or if you have simply dropped the course.To remove your index, simply type in **/removecourse** into the bot. The bot will respond in the following manner:

```
The bot will then display a keyboard listing all the courses you have inputted in your Google Calendar. Click on the course you want to remove **once**. 
Clicking the course you want to remove more than **once** may result in an error in your database.

If removal of course is successful, you will receive the following message from the bot:

```
Sucessfull! Your data has been recorded in our database!

What you probably want to do next:

Run /addevent to add another event

Run /removeevent to remove an event

Run /getevent to list all events you have added
```

If you are not free on that time span, you cannot create an event. For example you have an event on that time span you want to create a new event:
```

```
Hence, the bot will return:

Run /addevent to add an event

Run /getevent to list all events you have added
```

If you have no event in your Google Calendar, the bot will return you this following message:

## Chapter 5 Further Information
> [Back to contents](#contents)
### Information 1: 

For any commands that requires you to input a **date**:

If the bot returns you this response:
```
Your format is correct, however we cannot perform the query to your Google Account
```
Then these cases may occur:

Case 1: You have problems with your API keys

Case 2: You entered a bad date, for instance your end time is earlier than your start time (Your event starts at 5 p.m. but ends at 4 p.m.)

For these two cases, you may want to resolve your API problem and run the **/addevent** again and give the bot a reasonable time interval.

### Information 2

If the bot responds in this following manner:
```
Cannot access the course
```
This problem can be caused by these following cases:

Case 1: You may have problems with your browser driver, for instance you may have a problem with your chromedriver for Google Chrome.

Case 2: You may have entered a course code that **does not exist**

### Information 3

Take note that the command **/addfirstweek** can only accept a **Monday** as the start of the first week and first recess week. 
Check if you have inputted a **Monday** and no other day for the start of the first week and first recess week as a mistake here can lead to errors in the consequent commands such as **/addcourse**.

### Information 4

Whenever a keyboard is displayed for you to click, make sure you click on them only **once** . Clicking the keyboard more than once will result in an error in your database and the bot may not be able to run properly.

**Do not** scroll up and click on previous keyboard once you are done with that specific command. This can result in an error in your database and the bot may not be able to run properly.
