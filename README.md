Then copy the following and send it to BotFather:
```
start - This command is used to initially start the bot
addevent - This command is used to add your own personal events, for instance meetings or parties, etc. 
removeevent - This command is used to remove the personal events that you have added into the calendar. 
getevent - This command is used to display all the events you have put in your calendar.
setstudenttype - This command lets you tell the bot whether you are a Part Time Student or a Full Time Student.
addfirstweek - This command lets you enter the date of your first week and the date of your first recess week into the bot.
addcourse - This command allows you to add your courses according to your index into Google Calendar.

```
